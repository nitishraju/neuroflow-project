## Tools Summary

This project uses the React.js framework to set up a state-based web app easily. 
Since the table is not displayed until the data is ready, React makes it easy to render something else until then.

React Bootstrap is also used in this project. The library provides easy access to aesthetically pleasant assets such as
the Spinner and Table components. This saves a large amount of time creating custom styling for each part of the web app.

ESLint is also used to enforce code style in the project, allowing for readability and consistency across the project's code.
